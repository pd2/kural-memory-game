# Kural Memory game!

I developed a short term memory game using English transliteration of Thirukkural, an ancient book of 1330 proverbs written in classical Tamil language. Each kural has just 7 to 11 words perfectly suiting a short term memory game.

When the player gets it right they will see the meaning of the proverb, time taken by them and number of tries they needed to solve it.
